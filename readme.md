## About Cat 2

Think of the relationships between a ‘student’ and ‘fees payment’ in a school environment.  There is a form used to register a student (with details, student number, full name, date of birth and address) and another form used to record a fee payment (with details student that is paying fees, date of payment and amount) instance. Because it is not possible for all the students to pay their fees once, they are allowed to pay in ‘bits’. This means one student pays fees once or many times.
